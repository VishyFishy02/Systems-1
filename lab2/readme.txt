Run gdb on your bit_encode1 executable. Enter data here that
describes the interim values you calculated as you created your
8-bit key as you read in each separate digit of the 4-digit key.

Specify the gdb command you used to print the interim values
and how the values were displayed in gdb. 

For example, what is the value of key after you have read and processed the first
digit of the key, then after you have processed the second digit
of the key, etc. 

Printing the key in hexadecimal format might
help you determine if the value you are creating is correct.
