BY SUBMITTING THIS FILE TO CARMEN, I CERTIFY THAT I HAVE STRICTLY ADHERED TO
THE TENURES OF THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITYâ€™S ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY WITH
RESPECT TO THIS ASSIGNMENT.

THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 2.

Student Name: Vishal Kumar

2) This lab took me 12 hours to complete.

3) An interesting discovoery/ problem I encountered was during my creation
of the key, Orignially I had set the bits of the key as they came in; however,
this created the key in reverse, so I had to figure out how to manipulate the
index I passed in order to un-reverse during bit processing. Also, this lab took me
way longer than I expected not really becuase of the difficulty of the problem,
but because this is my first time with C so I basically learned as I went.

4) user input for key: 1010
value of key on iteration 0: 0x88
value of key on iteration 1: 0x88
value of key on iteration 2: 0xaa
value of key on iteration 3: 0xaa

I used the gdb command: disp /x key as well as a break pint right before I returned
the value of key in setBit() to see waht my hex value for my 8 bit key was after each
iteartion of my key processing loop in create_Key().

5) I did not need to run gdb on bit_encode2 beacuse I had already figured out the trick
for creating the key properly by then :).
