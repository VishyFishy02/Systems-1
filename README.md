# Systems 1

This repository contains projects for Systems 1: covering C and ASM (x86_64). Projects 4 and 6 showcase the most depth with C and assembly respectively

What I Learned
-------------------------------------------------------------
Problem solivng and programming with C and x86_64

Resilliance. This class is notoriously one of the hardest core classes any CSE Major at OSU will have to take. Not necessarly beacuse of the content, but rather, the intricacies and room for error with low level programming. Simply put there is no room for error.. Thinking back at the class it was a lot of late frusturating nights on discord calls with peers as we tried to figure out obscure segfaults and how to code an assembly. While I'm glad I took this class and proud I passed it, I'm happy that I wont be vising C or asm any tiem soon again!

Misc. Material:

    Makefiles: I became comfortable with makefiles and using them to build C / ASM projects with only one command.
    gcc: our compiling tool
    Debugging with gdb: I became  good at using gdb to look at registers and variable values to see where my code was performing unexpectedly.
    Compiling / Linking: Learned at a fairly low level how programs are compiled and linked together.

C Material:

    Pointers: Figured out how they worked and I'm very glad they are no longer a major feature in most languages
    Low-Level Memory Management: I learned how to manually allocate and free memory with malloc and calloc

Assembly Material:

    Opcodes: Learned all the basic opcodes (mov, lea, push, pop), etc.
    Registers / Calling Conventions: Learned how to use these, and calling conventions for where I could use which.
    Memory Layout: Learned how size suffixes worked, and how using different memory sizes affects how things are laid out in memory..
