# Systems-1

This repository contains projects for Systems 1: covering C and ASM (x86_64). Projects 4 and 6 showcase the most depth with C and assembly respectively

What I Learned
-------------------------------------------------------------
Problem solivng and programming with C and x86_64:

Misc. Material:

    Makefiles: I became comfortable with makefiles and using them to build C / ASM projects with only one command.
    gcc: our compiling tool
    Debugging with gdb: I became very good at using gdb to look at registers and variable values to see where my code was performing unexpectedly.
    Compiling / Linking: Learned at a fairly low level how programs are compiled and linked together.

C Material:

    Pointers: Figured out how they worked and I'm very glad they are no longer a major feature in most languages
    Low-Level Memory Management: I learned how to manually allocate and free memory.

Assembly Material:

    Opcodes: Learned all the basic opcodes (mov, lea, push, pop), etc.
    Registers / Calling Conventions: Learned how to use these, and calling conventions for where I could use which.
    Memory Layout: Learned how size suffixes worked, and how using different memory sizes affects how things are laid out in memory..
