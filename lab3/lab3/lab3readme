THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 3

Vishal Kumar

1) This lab took me about 10 hours of deep work to complete

2) concerns/discussion: I think my main gripe/concerns was really the tediousness of the indivudal fucntion c files and the 
vaguness of the task directions. the directions said that we should only three functions in our main program and gave us the
ability to adhere to the 10 line limit by creating additonal .c programs for each new function, but never specified if the orignal
program was only allowed to call the 3 main ones or call all of the functions. I was able to adhere to the 10 line limit with my main()
function calling the additional functions so I chose to call all of them. Also, thank goodness for the deadline
extension, I was juggling this lab with some of the hardest topics/problem sets that we will cover in FD2 and math 3345.

3) how I used gdb to check program:
I got quite a few segfaults throughout the entire lab, All of them had to do with memory allocation and accessing memory
I was able to figure out when my memory allocation was going berserk by having pointers in my populating list style functions
If I had populated the first index but gdb was showing that they first index pointer was null, then I knew somehow my memory
was getting screwed up. So I went back through my code and found that I was initializing each title str to be an array of 61 char
pointers instead of 61 chars themselves! Thats a lot of wasted memory. I also used gdb to figure out that I was poulating favorites
with the wrong index, I was using the index of the title itself in the booklist instead of the index of the for loop so when I
would later print out my favorites list, I was trying to acess null memory basically beacuse the favorite pointers were not
consecutive.
